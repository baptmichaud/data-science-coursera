# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

Welcome to my Course Project repository for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course on Coursera.

This repository contains 2 files:

* __run_analysis.R__ : an R script that transform a messy data set into a tidy dataset
* __CodeBook.md__ : a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that i performed to clean up the data into the **run_analysis.R** file
* __tidy_data.txt__ : the result of the run_analysis.R script

## Purpose of this analysis

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . 
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. 
The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 
A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: [Go to UCI website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
